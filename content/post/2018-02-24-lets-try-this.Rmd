This is a test to see how blogdown works. We'll eventually delte this. 

We'll run some inline calculations here `{r} 2+2`

And we'll include a table here 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::kable(mtcars)
```

And then, let's have a plot 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length, col = Species)) + 
  geom_point()
```
