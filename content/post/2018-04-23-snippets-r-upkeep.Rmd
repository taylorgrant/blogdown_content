Snippet files periodically updated. These functions and commands are relevant for working with R and RStudio. 

### Easily updating R

The `updateR` package is fantastic. Just using this line of code with the admin_password set will update everything and keep all packages in the new version of R. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
updateR(admin_password = "admin_password")
```

### Finding all functions in a package

This is especially useful when using a dev version of a package. Often, there are github files, but it's sometimes easier to just use `asNamespace` to see functions. 

For example, let's look at the functions available within the spotifyR package. 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
fns <- unclass(lsf.str(envir = asNamespace("spotifyr"), all = T))

fns
```
