Snippet files are periodically updated with how-toâ€™s for data wrangling. These commands are relevant for regular expressions and string queries. 

# Pulling out text before or after symbol/space/other
```{r}
# timestamp as example 
stamp <- "2017-10-16T12:45:04PM"
# time: pull out everything after the T
gsub(".*\\T", "", stamp) 
# date: pull out everything before the T
gsub("\\T.*", "", stamp) 
```

# Pulling text after first occurrence in string with multiple occurrences
```{r}
# simple example 
sub(".*?_",'', "this_is_a_concatenated_string")
```

# Keeping only the last occurrence in string with multiple occurrences
```{r}
sub(".*[_]", "", "abc_def_ghi_jkl")
```

# Dropping everything after the last occurrence in string with multiple occurrences
```{r}
sub("_[^_]+$", "", "abc_def_ghi_jkl")
```

# Splitting and pulling data after symbols. 

There are also pure regex ways of achieving the same ends, but stringr is so easy. The `str_split` function returns a list, and we then pull out the specific list element that we want. This command works nicely when working with dataframes and `dplyr` - simply mutate with this command to create a new variable. 
```{r}
library(stringr)
# assume a url with the following path, and we want to pull out the 
# info after the 2nd slash
urlPath <- "/t5/Announcements-and-Info/Bixby-Button-Short-Press-The-choice-is-yours/m-p/168685/highlight/true#M210"

sapply(str_split(urlPath, "/"), "[[", 3)
```

# Remove commas and convert string to numeric

This is actually taken directly from [hrbrmstr](https://rud.is/b/2017/11/02/yet-another-power-outages-post-full-tidyverse-edition/){target="_blank"}, who is fantastic. 
```{r}
to_num <- function(x) { as.numeric(stringi::stri_replace_all_fixed(x, ",", "")) }
stringnum <- "100,954"
to_num(stringnum)
```

# Add commas and convert numeric to string

In the alternative, sometimes you want comma separators for pretty tables or something. 

```{r}
library(scales)    
comma_format()(10000000)
```

# Pull out the last N and first N characters in string

The ```str_sub``` function from the ```stringr``` package is useful for this. There are three arguments (string, from = start, to = end) - if you don't include "from" and "to" is positive, then it starts from character 1. If "from" is left out and "to" is negative, it starts from the last character in the string. 
```{r}
st <- "Thisstringhasnospaces"
# Last word
str_sub(st, -6)
# First word  
str_sub(st, 1, 4)
# In between
str_sub(st, 5, 10)
```

# Programmatically inserting a line break every N spaces

Found this useful when working with lots of data and using a function to parse the data and plot using ggplot. 
```{r, warning=FALSE}
strfun <- function(str, n) {gsub(paste0("([^ ]+( +[^ ]+){",n-1,"}) +"),
                              "\\1\n", str)}

string <- "As he crossed toward the pharmacy at the corner he involuntarily turned his head because of a burst of light that had ricocheted from his temple..."

strfun(string, 8)

```

# Adding line break after N characters 

```{r}
string <- "As he crossed toward the pharmacy at the corner he involuntarily turned his head because of a burst of light that had ricocheted from his temple..."

paste(strwrap(string, width = 80), collapse = "\n")
```

# Counting words in a string

Working with strings and trying to count either words or occurrences. 

```{r, warning = FALSE}
library(stringr)
string <- c("MTD Sales 415  2,667 1  2,014  46   24  52   472  3  2,200  2,256 2,963 25 511  207
            274  14,130")

# this will look for all word characters
str_count(string, '\\w+')

# the above is counting commas as breaks, so remove the comma count
str_count(string, '\\w+') - str_count(string, ",") 
```

# Removing trailing and leading punctuation

In this case, we'll strip out periods, but the punctuation can be replaced

```{r}
test <- c('.name.1.','name.2','.name.3.')
gsub('^\\.|\\.$', '', test)
```

# Efficiently converting all versions of a word

Working with text and there are different versions and misspellings of a term

```{r}
string <- "i was buffereing but then buffered and buffering on the bluff"
# assuming a consistent word stem
str_replace_all(string, "buffer[a-z]+", "buffer")
```

# Splitting words on space or other character

```{r}
string <- c("apple: banana: orange: kiwi")
str_split(string, boundary('word'))
```
