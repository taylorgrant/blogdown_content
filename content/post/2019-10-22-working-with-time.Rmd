```{r , setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

```
Snippet files are periodically updated with how-toâ€™s for working with time/date formats, which are notoriously terrible in R. 

# What are the time formats 

These are the different formats that can be used when referencing pieces of time. 
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

tibble(code = c("%d", "%m", "%b", "%B", "%y", "%Y"),
       value = c("Day of month (numeric)", "Month (numeric)", "Month (abbreviated)",
       "Month (full name)", "Year (2 digit)", "Year (4 digit)")) %>%
         knitr::kable()
```

# Current date and time

```{r}
Sys.Date()
Sys.time()
```

# Converting string to date

Assume you have a string and need to convert it to a date. Make sure the format matches that of the string.   
```{r}
string <- "2017/10/10"
as.Date(string, format = "%Y/%m/%d")
```

Or, use lubridate
```{r}
string <- "2017/10/10"
lubridate::ymd(string)
```

# Sequencing dates 

```{r}
seq.Date(from = as.Date("2019-10-01"), to = as.Date("2019-10-07"), by = "days")
```

# Rounding dates

```{r}
x <- tibble(date = seq.Date(from = as.Date("2019-09-29"), to = as.Date("2019-10-07"), by = "days"))

x %>% mutate(week_date = lubridate::floor_date(date, "week"),
             month_date = lubridate::floor_date(date, "month"),
             quarter_date = lubridate::floor_date(date, "quarter"))
```

# Rounding to quarters, without standard date format

Can use the `zoo` package to convert to workable form. 

```{r}
x <- tibble(date = seq.Date(from = as.Date("2019-09-29"), to = as.Date("2019-10-07"), by = "days"))
x %>% mutate(Quarter = zoo::as.yearqtr(date, format = "%Y-%m-%d"))  
```
