Snippet files are periodically updated with tips and tricks as I learn them. These commands are relevant for packages within the `tidyverse`.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, glue)
```

# Using setNames to change column names

The `colnames` function can be used, as can `rename()`, but for ease of use while piping commands, the `setNames()` function is the easiest. You can either reference a vector of names or you can also reference a specific row within the data if that's necessary. For example, in [this post](https://taylorgrant.netlify.com/2018/05/using-rvest-to-import-and-html-table/){target="_blank"} after scraping an html table the column names were in the second row. In that case, we can just reference the row by its location - `%>% setNames(.[2,])` 

```{r}
names <- c("name1", "name2", "name3", "name4")

df <- tibble(
  a = sample(letters, 4),
  b = sample(1:100, 4),
  c = sample(1:100, 4),
  d = sample(letters, 4)
)

df %>% setNames(names)
```

# Using rename_at to rename specific columns 

Occasionally, you'll only want to rename certain columns and the `rename_at` function offers this capability, in much the same way as `mutate_at` or `summarise_at`. 

```{r}
df <- tibble(
  a = sample(letters, 4),
  b = sample(1:100, 4),
  c = sample(1:100, 4),
  d = sample(letters, 4)
)

df <- df %>% 
  rename_at(vars(b,d), ~ paste0("pastedName_", .))
df
```

# Mutate and Summarise multiple columns 

This is well summarised [here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise_all.html){target="_blank"}, but a few examples are below. When using either `mutate_at()` or `summarise_at` it's important to include the "vars(), funs()" format. 

```{r} 
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(disp, drat, mpg), funs(median, mean))
```

The [helper functions](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select_helpers.html){target="_blank"} for `select()` are also useful for selecting variables. Though note that when using helpers such as `contains()` that you can only include one string. For instance, this will work.

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  summarise_at(vars(contains("ar")), funs(mean))
```

But this won't
```{r}
mtcars %>%
  summarise_at(vars(contains("ar|mp")), funs(mean))
```

If you want to match across multiple strings, the `matches()` function will do the trick. 

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  summarise_at(vars(matches("ar|mp")), funs(mean))
```

# Mutating multiple date formats within the same column

I was recently dealing with several large datasets that contain multiple date formats. I had been trying to set the dates as `as.POSIXct` formats, and it wasn't until trying to use the `difftime` function that I realized several years were in two digit, rather than four digit format. The problem is that when specifying the date format, a two digit year pads itself with two extra zeros as seen below in the try_date column.

```{r}
df <- tibble(
  dates = c("30/05/2017 07:20", "19/6/17 13:47")
)

df %>% mutate(try_date = as.POSIXct(dates, tz = "", format = "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M"))
```

To get around this, we can use the `lubridate` package to solve our issues. In this case, I'm splitting out my dates and times before gluing them back together. the `dmy()` function automatically converts the `%y` into `%Y`.  

```{r, warning = FALSE}
df <- tibble(
  dates = c("30/05/2017 07:20", "19/6/17 13:47")
)

df %>% 
  mutate(working_date = lubridate::dmy(gsub("\\ .*", "", dates)),
         hour = gsub(".*\\ ", "", dates),
         final_date = as.POSIXct(glue("{working_date} {hour}"), tz="", format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"))
```

# Multiple left_joins using dplyr

It's always possible to use multiple `left_join` functions, but the easiest way to do merge multiple data sets together may be to put everything into a list and then use the `Reduce` function. I had used `map` to work over a lot of data, so everything was in a list. I then took the data I wanted to use as my base and concatenated it to the list. 

```
tmp <- c(list(df), original_list)
```

Then, using dplyr commands was able to join all of the data. In this case, my original list had 30 separate dataframes.

```
mass_df <- tmp %>% Reduce(function(df1, df2), left_join(df1, df2), .)
```
The `left_join` command can be further defined to specify what we're joining by, or to select only specific columns that will be joined. 
```
# using "matches" to pull out specific variables
mass_df <- tmp %>% Reduce(function(df1, df2), left_join(df1, select(df2, matches("avar|bvar"))), .)

# specifying what the join is by
mass_df <- tmp %>% Reduce(function(df1, df2), left_join(df1, df2, by = "index"), .)
```

# Selection of multiple variables

When using either `select` or wanting to `mutate_at` there are lots of helpers -- `starts_with`, `ends_with`, `contains`, and `matches` and probably some that I'm missing. 

`contains` only works on a single, specific request, whereas `matches` allows for an OR. 

```{r}
tmp <- tibble(g1_letters = sample(letters, 5), 
              g1_num = sample(1:600000, 5),
              g2_letters = sample(letters, 5),
              g2_num = sample(1:60000, 5),
              h1_letters = sample(letters, 5),
              h1_num = sample(1:60000, 5))

# or statement
tmp <- tmp %>% select(matches("g1|h1"))
tmp
```

But we can also use the `intersect` function to create an AND statement

```{r}
tmp <- tibble(g1_letters = sample(letters, 5), 
              g1_num = sample(1:600000, 5),
              g1_weighted = g1_num*.4,
              g2_letters = sample(letters, 5),
              g2_num = sample(1:60000, 5),
              g2_weighted = g2_num*.4,
              h1_letters = sample(letters, 5),
              h1_num = sample(1:60000, 5),
              h1_weighted = h1_num*.4)

tmp <- tmp %>% 
  summarise_at(vars(matches("num|weighted")), sum) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(intersect(starts_with("g1"), contains("weighted"))), 
            funs(paste0(., "sel")))
tmp
```

# dplyr - group_split function

An interesting addition to dplyr is the new `group_split` function which groups by a specific variable and then splits the data into separate lists. 

Not sure when I'm going to use this, but wanted to put it here. 

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
data(starwars)

split_by <- starwars %>%
  group_by(gender)

group_split(split_by)

```

# Piping into a t.test

```{r}
tibble(a = c(rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd = 5),rnorm(100, mean = 80, sd = 5)),
       group = c(rep("green", 100), rep("blue", 100))) %>%
  t.test(a ~ group, data = ., var.equal = TRUE)
  
```

# Arranging within a group

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
ToothGrowth %>%
    group_by(supp) %>%
    arrange(len, .by_group = TRUE)
```
